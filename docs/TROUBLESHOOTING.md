# Troubleshooting

## Sessions don't appear

Sessions are created when Claude Code hooks fire. If a session was started before the hooks were configured, it won't appear until its next event (sending a prompt, finishing, or hitting a permission prompt).

**Fix:** Send a new prompt in the session, or restart it. You can also click the gear icon and hit "Refresh sessions" to scan for running Claude processes.

## Some sessions show "Projects" as the name

The project name comes from the directory where you started Claude Code (`basename $CWD`). If you started Claude Code from `/Users/you/Projects/`, it'll show "Projects" instead of a specific project name.

**Fix:** Start Claude Code from inside the project directory:
```bash
cd ~/Projects/my-project && claude
```

## Click doesn't switch terminal tabs

The monitor matches terminal tabs by TTY device path. Check the session's JSON file in `~/.claude/monitor/sessions/`:

```bash
cat ~/.claude/monitor/sessions/*.json | jq '{project, terminal, terminal_session_id}'
```

If `terminal_session_id` is empty, the hook couldn't detect the terminal. Send another prompt in that session to backfill it.

**Why it might be empty:** The hook detects the TTY by walking the process tree (`ps -o ppid=`). If the process tree is unusually deep or the parent shell doesn't have a TTY (rare), detection fails gracefully.

## No voice announcements

Check these in order:

1. **Master toggle** — is `announce.enabled` set to `true` in `config.json`? Also check the toggle in the settings popover (gear icon).

2. **Volume** — is `announce.volume` above `0.0`?

3. **Provider** — if using ElevenLabs:
   - Is `tts_provider` set to `"elevenlabs"`?
   - Does the `.env` file exist at the path specified in `elevenlabs.env_file`?
   - Does it contain a valid `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`?
   - Is the `voice_id` valid?

4. **Test manually:**
   ```bash
   echo '{"session_id":"test","cwd":"/tmp"}' | ~/.claude/hooks/monitor.sh Stop
   ```
   You should hear "tmp done" (or see an error).

5. **ElevenLabs fallback** — if the ElevenLabs API call fails (bad key, network issue), the hook automatically falls back to macOS `say`. If you hear Samantha instead of your ElevenLabs voice, check your API key.

## Voice picker shows no voices

The settings popover fetches voices from ElevenLabs on app launch. It only shows your **library** voices (cloned, generated, professional) — not premade ones.

If the list is empty:
- Verify your `.env` file path and API key
- Make sure you have at least one voice in your ElevenLabs voice library
- The built-in "human robot" voice should always appear (it's in config.json, not fetched)

## Panel doesn't appear after build

Check if it's running:
```bash
pgrep -l claude_monitor
```

Kill and rebuild:
```bash
pkill -9 claude_monitor && ~/.claude/monitor/build.sh
```

If compilation fails, make sure Xcode Command Line Tools are installed:
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

## Panel is in the wrong position

Reset the saved position:
```bash
defaults delete claude_monitor monitorX
defaults delete claude_monitor monitorY
pkill claude_monitor && ~/.claude/monitor/build.sh
```

It will reappear in the top-right corner.

## Sessions stay after Claude Code exits

Normally, the `SessionEnd` hook removes the session file after 5 seconds. If sessions persist:

- The terminal tab might still be open (the liveness check only prunes when the TTY is gone)
- The `SessionEnd` hook might not have fired (crash, SIGKILL)

**Fix:** Close the terminal tab (the liveness check will clean it up within 5 seconds), or click the X button on the session row.

## Build warnings

The Swift compiler may show deprecation warnings. These are cosmetic and don't affect functionality. Common ones:

- `launchApplication` deprecation — the code uses the modern `openApplication(at:configuration:)` API
- `onChange(of:perform:)` — may appear on newer macOS versions

## Hook adds latency to Claude Code

Each hook invocation adds ~10ms of overhead (mostly from the `ps` process tree walk for TTY detection). This is imperceptible in normal use. The TTS call runs in the background and doesn't block.
